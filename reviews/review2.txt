I take pottery classes here. It is amazing! After a semester of class so far, I have learned so much, and the people are so friendly and helpful. Also, it is nice to have useful art afterwards. Whether you have been doing ceramics for a long time or have never tried it before, you will find fellow students at your level in every class. Dan does a great job showing new techniques to both the new person and more experienced people. I highly recommend this place!
