I've purchased a couple of items from this studio and I've been thrilled with both of them. One was a gift and the other was for myself. If you want to find a good, locally made product for a number of gift-giving occasions, you should stop by Fireborn. There really seem to be endless possibilities available with what the owner of this shop crafts. While I have to admit, its a bit odd to be followed around the store as though I were a convicted shoplifter (happend on both occasions), once I got past that and focused on the task at hand, I was over it. This place also sells jewelry and has pottery classes, which I would try if I still lived in the area. There are also great sales if you get on the mailing list.
