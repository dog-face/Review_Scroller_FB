I was so amazed by this studio!  Not just because there were incredibly beautiful handmade items, but because it was actually affordable for a regular girl like me!  

I feel like you walk into some galleries that you can buy merchandise in and there's NO WAY you could afford the pieces of art unless you were a millionaire (or won the lottery, whatev).  Here, you'll find totally affordable pieces that are still incredibly beautiful and great to take home or buy as a gift.  I spied pottery type vases for only $30, glass vases for $60 and other sets for the kitchen around $100.  A price for anyone!

There's a mix of pottery, glass, woodwork and a small selection of paintings.  Most of the items are pottery or glass though.  You can either pick from totally functional pieces for your kitchen or pieces of art to display in your house.  You know, those fancy bowls you can turn into art on the walls.  And I thought it was just one room, but then you just walk into the front room and there's a whole other room in the back filled with ton of other amazing treasures!

Again, if I was a millionaire, I could have picked out a ton of pieces for my own house between the kitchenware, art and glass items.  I felt as if I could own my own part of a Chihuly, without spending the money!  I loved the fancy glass vases, pottery tea pots and pottery sushi sets.  Since it was Christmas, they also had some beautiful hand blown glass ornaments hanging in

I'm telling you, if you need a unique gift for someone, or you're looking for a non-Ikea type place to decorate your walls with, this is the place to visit!  I swear, you won't regret it!
