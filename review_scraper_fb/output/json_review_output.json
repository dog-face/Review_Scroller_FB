["I have purchased beautiful unique pottery gifts from Fireborn Studios for years.  Everyone I have given them to has loved them.   I enjoy giving a one of a kind gift that will be used and enjoyed.   The glazes are extraordinarily gorgeous and varied.   And there is always a wide selection that is changing all the time.  You are sure to find something you like.   I purchased a teapot years ago that I use every day.  I love it as much today as the day I chose it!", "I take pottery classes here. It is amazing! After a semester of class so far, I have learned so much, and the people are so friendly and helpful. Also, it is nice to have useful art afterwards. Whether you have been doing ceramics for a long time or have never tried it before, you will find fellow students at your level in every class. Dan does a great job showing new techniques to both the new person and more experienced people. I highly recommend this place!", "I was so amazed by this studio!  Not just because there were incredibly beautiful handmade items, but because it was actually affordable for a regular girl like me!  \n\nI feel like you walk into some galleries that you can buy merchandise in and there's NO WAY you could afford the pieces of art unless you were a millionaire (or won the lottery, whatev).  Here, you'll find totally affordable pieces that are still incredibly beautiful and great to take home or buy as a gift.  I spied pottery type vases for only $30, glass vases for $60 and other sets for the kitchen around $100.  A price for anyone!\n\nThere's a mix of pottery, glass, woodwork and a small selection of paintings.  Most of the items are pottery or glass though.  You can either pick from totally functional pieces for your kitchen or pieces of art to display in your house.  You know, those fancy bowls you can turn into art on the walls.  And I thought it was just one room, but then you just walk into the front room and there's a whole other room in the back filled with ton of other amazing treasures!\n\nAgain, if I was a millionaire, I could have picked out a ton of pieces for my own house between the kitchenware, art and glass items.  I felt as if I could own my own part of a Chihuly, without spending the money!  I loved the fancy glass vases, pottery tea pots and pottery sushi sets.  Since it was Christmas, they also had some beautiful hand blown glass ornaments hanging in\n\nI'm telling you, if you need a unique gift for someone, or you're looking for a non-Ikea type place to decorate your walls with, this is the place to visit!  I swear, you won't regret it!", "I've purchased a couple of items from this studio and I've been thrilled with both of them. One was a gift and the other was for myself. If you want to find a good, locally made product for a number of gift-giving occasions, you should stop by Fireborn. There really seem to be endless possibilities available with what the owner of this shop crafts. While I have to admit, its a bit odd to be followed around the store as though I were a convicted shoplifter (happend on both occasions), once I got past that and focused on the task at hand, I was over it. This place also sells jewelry and has pottery classes, which I would try if I still lived in the area. There are also great sales if you get on the mailing list.", "Whether you want to buy pottery or take a pottery class, Fireborn Studios is the place to go in Pittsburgh. The gallery showcases Dan Vito's work but also sells work by other local potters and has a good selection of handblown glass. \n\nPottery classes are offered during the day or in the evening, with lots of flexibility built in to accommodate busy schedules. The instruction is fabulous, the glaze selection is extensive, and firings are consistently spot on.", "This is a wonderful gallery on Pittsburgh's South Side.  Beautiful pottery, glassware, jewelry and other work of some outstanding artists and craftsmen.  I have bought a number of pieces there over the years and know the owners well.", "Meet owner and artist and tour the studio. Glass and pottery are excellent quality and value. Glass made nationally. Pottery made locally. Enjoy!", "Beautiful pottery with unique glazes.  The quality of the pottery is exceptional and it is stunning.  Their pieces are both functional and beautiful.", "Dan Vito makes wonderful pottery and sells it and others'\nterrific pieces as well.  I often go in to buy gifts and end up \nbuying even more for myself.  Fascinating glazes and explanations \nof the work, the pieces are lovely, durable and useful.  Highly recommended.", "An array of carefully crafted pottery, items large & small.  I found a lovely Japanese sak\u00e9 set for my girlfriend's birthday.", "The glazes are perfect on every piece. The classes are great and the staff are very helpful  and knowledgeable. I have a great time there.", "Great selection of high quality ceramics.  Love the bowls that I purchased!", "Very nice pottery and glass. Shop there once or twice a year.", "Year after year, for birthdays, weddings, or just because , We have purchased gifts here. My own cabinets are filled with everything from bowls to mugs to serving dishes and we use them daily! "]
