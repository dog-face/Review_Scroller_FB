I have purchased beautiful unique pottery gifts from Fireborn Studios for years.  Everyone I have given them to has loved them.   I enjoy giving a one of a kind gift that will be used and enjoyed.   The glazes are extraordinarily gorgeous and varied.   And there is always a wide selection that is changing all the time.  You are sure to find something you like.   I purchased a teapot years ago that I use every day.  I love it as much today as the day I chose it!
